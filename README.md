<h1 align="center">GraphQL Restaurant Data Exercise</h1>

## Description

 - This is a programming exercise to demonstrate the practice of using GraphQL to query and mutate specific data in a database.
 - Creating multi-tier applications means building multiple API endpoints to handle different data operations. 
 - The more complex your application becomes, the harder it is to maintain all these endpoints. 
 - GraphQL aims to reduce this complexity by providing a simpler view of data and making it easier to query it.
